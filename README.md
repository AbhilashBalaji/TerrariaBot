# Benchmarking Terraria
Repo contains two projects , slightly modified to work
* The base bot code - [Menia](https://github.com/Xwilarg/Meina)
* The client-side library - [TerrariaBot](https://github.com/Xwilarg/TerrariaBot)

## How to run it
This is a visual studio project and should be able to load up directly by importing the Menia.sln file. 

Or

Programmatically, `dotnet Meina.dll`
